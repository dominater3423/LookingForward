                    <p>These are a couple poems from Nietzsche. Remember that he wrote in German, and it's very hard to translate poetry. If your first reaction is this isn't very refined, that's the reason. I think it's fine though, but obviously no poet am I.</p>
                    <h3>Medicine for Pessimists</h3>
                    <p>Nothing tastes good to you, my friend?<br>I'm tired of your belly-aching.<br>You spit, rage, slander without end;<br>My patience and my heart are breaking.<br>I have a remedy; just follow<br>My good advice and rest assured:<br>A toad is what you need to swallow,<br>And your dyspepsia will be cured. </p>
                    <h3>The Pious Retort</h3>
                    <p>God loves us. because we are made by him.<br>"But man made God!" say the refined.<br>Should he not love what he designed?<br>Should he, because he made him, now deny him?<br>That inference limps; it has a cloven mind.</p>
                    <p>Once upon a time this would've shocked. Funny, looking at history almost forces you to adopt a relativistic views of morals.</p>
