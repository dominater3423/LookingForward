                    <h3>On Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p>Anticipation has broken many of men. The best way to live one's life is nobly and in the moment. One lives nobly by bearing the toils that life brings him in a way that doesn't degrade his character. For this to be achievable, which so few have the strength, one has to be free of his environment. That means living for one's self, not others. Altruism is for those who can't help themselves. Which is not to say the altruistic is a parasite, but it is simply a fact he can't hold a candle, nor do more good, than a man of high culture.</p>
                    <p>This noble spirit can't be a slave to others, for they aren't worthy. One can't look at the past for all the answers. The future is terrifying, but that is what makes it enticing. Or to always be in need of a mirror, always conscious of dress, to feel the need to put on a mask in front of others, this is a deprived soul, at the complete mercy of others.</p>
                    <p>What is there to look forward to? If you examine closely everything is the same. Like a tourist, with the delusion that elsewhere is any different than home. In this day and age everybody has come to California. The clever ones understand that they traverse a country infinitely more in a movie or novel than in reality. Those foreigners who have devoured the culture exported from the French always end up a little disappointed if they ever do set foot in the country herself, for it is real, all too real.</p>
                    <p>Further than that, if one chooses to live a lifestyle where the main goal is to simply aim for the next attraction, that's no good of a way to go about your life. You'll always be disappointed, since you expect too much. Much better to be an adventurer, a free spirit, who delights in the journey, not the destination. The former is condemned to a static character, the latter is dynamic because of the fact he is not scared off when something is new.</p>
                    <p>Along with that it has to be remembered that like all other emotions, pleasure and pain are inherently intertwined. Since we humans judge the good of actions on the basis of how much pleasure they bring, taking in to account both that of the individual and society, and that good seems to be what most people consider as the end of all morality; we see that good is merely instrumental for pleasure. One cannot have one without the other. Great happiness is always preceded by great suffering. It is a comedy, not in the modern sense!, of human nature. On this realization it would seem wise then, for one who wishes a tranquil life, like the Epicureans, to minimize their exposure to both. For those who wish for a truly creative existence, for this is noble, one has to be willing to sacrifice tranquility. It is no coincidence that the greatest artists, thinkers, and free spirits have tragic stories, it is simply inevitably. One only has to look at Socrates, Dante, Machiavelli, Virgil, Spinoza, Nietzsche, etc. to attest to this fact. For what is a philosopher but the noblest of all artists? To specialize it requires blood, sweat, and tears. That who can survive the process and come out scarred, but not broken, are those who achieve the noblest of heights.</p>
