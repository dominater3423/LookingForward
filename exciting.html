                    <h3>Break</h3>
                    <p>I'll be honest, don't really enjoy break all that much. Doesn't feel different from when society makes me do something. Oh course, I love my lesiure, but I tend to spend that time doing stuff that is way more intensive that what the school gives me. In a weird way the hours I spend in school are my break.</p>
                    <h3>Geometry</h3>
                    <p>I am behind in math, and just about every other subject, thanks dtech, so I decided to take geometry over the summer. It was a rather bureaucratic process, I think I had to wait on like five separate individuals. What a pain! Finally got enrolled a couple days ago from the time I'm writing this. I guess if there's anything I'm looking forward to it is getting the geometry book I ordered to supplement the class. I just like receiving books, especially when it is a quality volume. There is something satisfying about it. I looked at a few textbooks and decided on this one: 0387966544. It is by Serge Lang, who is a reputed author of many a quality textbooks. I looked at the pdf and it looked fine.</p>
                    <h3>Time Off</h3>
                    <p>I do have like a week between when school ends and that CSM class starts. Think I'll spend a little of that time getting a jump start, so I'm not completely lost the first day. Another thing I'm trying to do is finish the complete works of Nietzsche, which isn't as big of a task as it sounds. He was a writer of many books, but most aren't especially technical; not an encyclopedic philosopher such as Hegel, Kant, and Aristotle. Now if you want to read and understand those three, you're in for a ride. It's also a little easier for me since I've read other philosophical works. The Kaufman translations are basically the universally accepted English translations. You can get his main works in two compact volume. He also wrote a biography of him, so that's a good primer.</p>
                    <h3>Sword Art Online</h3>
                    <p>I swear, I don't watch too many animes. Wish I had the time though. Anyway, I downloaded the series again after like a year and played back a few of the episodes. The show should've ended exactly when Kirito defeated Heathcliff. That would've made the show beautiful. Unfortunately, either some romantic or money lover decided to have both of them survive and have another dozen or so episodes. I believe they also released a second season and a spin-off. He also becomes a little too soft towards the end. It's still a great show though, don't get me wrong.</p>
